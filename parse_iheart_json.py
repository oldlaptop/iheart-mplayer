	will return a (potentially very large) dict containing detailed search

	locations, radio band/frequency, call letters, URLs to logo images, the
	search algorithm's "score", and potentially other data. In addition

	# http://api.iheart.com/api/v1/catalog/searchAll?&keywords=<keywords>
	#
	# where <keywords> is a search term, will be UTF-8 encoded JSON giving
	# detailed search results; containing both search metadata and detailed
	# information on all search results. Importantly, ID numbers for search
	# results are included.
	#
	# There are a great many additional parameters that the official app
	# includes. A full API request URL from the official app follows:
	#
	# http://api2.iheart.com/api/v1/catalog/searchAll?&keywords=wjr&bestMatch=True&queryStation=True&queryArtist=True&queryTrack=True&queryTalkShow=True&startIndex=0&maxRows=12&queryFeaturedStation=False&queryBundle=False&queryTalkTheme=False&amp_version=4.11.0
