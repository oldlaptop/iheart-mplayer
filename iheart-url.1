.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
fetches the URL for an iHeartRadio station's audio stream from iHeartRadio's
API servers and prints it to stdout. It is meant to be used with audio players
and the command substitution syntax in most shells, like so:
.Bd -literal -offset -indent
$ mplayer -novideo "$(iheart-url [station_id])"
.Ed

.Nm iheart-mplayer
is a trivial POSIX sh wrapper scripts that does precisely that for the
.Nm mplayer
media player, or for
.Nm mpv
or
.Nm vlc
if it is called by the corresponding names.

The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
Disable TLS; all API requests will be done in cleartext, and only cleartext
stream URLS will be returned. May prevent any valid stream URL from being
returned, in the event that the station has only TLS streams.
.It Fl h
Display a help message. Meaningless for wrapper scripts.
.It Fl i
Instead of printing the URL for a station, output some human-readable info about
it. Meaningless for wrapper scripts.
.It Fl l Ar terms
.Dq I'm feeling lucky
search for terms; print the URL of the
.Dq best
result according to iHeartRadio's servers.
.It Fl s Ar terms
Run a search for terms, outputting vital information like station ID for each
result. Meaningless for wrapper scripts.
.It Fl v
Increase verbosity level, may be specified multiple times for more verbosity.
Useful in conjunction with
.Fl s.
Meaningless for wrapper scripts.
.It station_id

.Fl i
or
.Fl s.

$ iheart-url -vs Sports
.Ed

Play the best match for the search term
.Dq Classic rock
in mpv
.Pq note the use of double quotes to prevent the shell from field-splitting the search term:
.Bd -literal -offset -indent
$ iheart-mpv -l "Classic rock"
.Ed
.Sh CAVEATS
While most media players capable of handling network streams will be able to use
these URLs, the lack of public documentation concerning iHeartRadio's API
precludes any guarantees about the content provided. Also because of the lack of
documentation, much of this tool's functionality relies on information gained
from deep-packet inspection of official iHeartRadio apps' traffic and on trial
and error. The iHeartRadio API has been known to change on occasion and break 
iheart-url's functionality. Technical documentation derived from this tool's
development may be found in its source code and in the 'iheart-url' file in the
source distribution.
.Sh BUGS
.Nm iheart-mplayer,
.Nm iheart-mpv,
and
.Nm iheart-vlc
naively pass all their arguments to iheart-url, and all of iheart-url's stdio
output as an argument to the player. Players do not particularly like the output
of
.Fl h,
.Fl i,
or
.Fl s.

Multiple people have reported intermittent outages of the iHeartRadio API,
during which it may return HTTP errors for iheart-url's requests for certain
stations.

Python may raise string encoding exceptions if the console does not support
UTF-8. Setting
.Ev PYTHONIOENCODING
to something like ":namereplace" in the environment is recommended.
