.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
fetches the URL for an iHeartRadio station's audio stream from iHeartRadio's
API servers and prints it to stdout.
It is meant to be used with audio players and the command substitution syntax in
most shells, like so:
.Bd -literal -offset -indent
$ mplayer -novideo "$(iheart-url [station_id])"
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm iheart-mplayer
is a trivial POSIX sh wrapper scripts that does precisely that for the

The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds

.Sh CAVEATS
While most media players capable of handling network streams will be able to use
these URLs, the lack of public documentation concerning iHeartRadio's API
precludes any guarantees about the content provided.
Also because of the lack of documentation, much of this tool's functionality
relies on information gained from deep-packet inspection of official iHeartRadio
apps' traffic and on trial and error.
The iHeartRadio API has been known to change on occasion and break iheart-url's
functionality.
Technical documentation derived from this tool's development may be found in its
source code and in the 'iheart-api' file in the source distribution.
.Sh BUGS
.Nm iheart-mplayer ,
.Nm iheart-mpv ,
and
.Nm iheart-vlc
naively pass all their arguments to iheart-url, and all of iheart-url's stdout
output as an argument to the player.
Players do not particularly like the output of
.Fl h ,
.Fl i ,
or
.Fl s .
.Pp
Multiple people have reported intermittent outages of the iHeartRadio API,
during which it may return HTTP errors for iheart-url's requests for certain
stations.
.Pp
Python may raise string encoding exceptions if the console does not support
UTF-8.
Setting
.Ev PYTHONIOENCODING
to something like ":namereplace" in the environment is recommended.
